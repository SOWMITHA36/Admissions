    <h1>Engineering</h1>
    <p>Engineering is the application of natural science, mathematics, and engineering design to solve technical problems, improve systems, and increase productivity and efficiency. Here are some different types of engineering offered by our university:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <img src="civil.jpg" alt="Civil Engineering">
            <b>Civil engineering:</b> Involves the design, construction, maintenance, and inspection of large civil infrastructure projects, such as roads, railways, bridges, tunnels, and dams.
            <p>
                The Civil Engineering course duration at the postgraduate level is a two-year program, divided into four semesters. Some subjects include Theory of Elasticity, Industrial Structures, and Theory of Plates and Shells.
